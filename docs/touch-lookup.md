# Touch selection and highlighting

Settings → OCR & lookup → Highlight chooses **Whole word** (default) or
**Character**. This is a presentation choice: navigation still advances one
Unicode character and local dictionaries still return at most one result.
Whole word uses the matched source span, including an inflected ending, rather
than the dictionary's normalized spelling. While a lookup runs or has no result,
it highlights the selected character instead. Changing the preference preserves
the recognized text; opening again performs only the normal selected lookup.

Tap a character in the recognized sentence at the top of the open overlay to
look up the word starting there. This selects the overlay's recognized header,
not an unrecognized glyph in the game's framebuffer. Japanese-only selection
applies equally to arrows and touch: a tap on Latin text, digits, punctuation or
Hangul has no effect when it is ON. A held finger produces one request; it must
be released before another tap. Touch already held while opening is ignored.

The overlay keeps Shell's front touch region active through normal and crop
modes and releases it on close. Its existing game input block still filters
game touch calls. Entering or leaving the crop editor does not briefly hand
front touches back to the game. Failed region activation is not marked active.

Hit testing allocates no memory and runs only on a new touch. It uses the
header's measured PAF character starts, line count, content height and current
scroll. The header has one font size, so the line pitch is measured height
divided by line count, as in existing header scrolling. The trailing cell on a
line is bounded by the configured Japanese point width; it is not a separately
measured glyph bitmap. Blank trailing areas and clipped header rows have no hit.
CR omission, UTF-16 surrogate pairs, UTF-8 source offsets and wrapped lines are
handled without borrowing dictionary arena pointers outside the view lock.
Undocumented `LineInfo.frame` fields and `GetNextDownHit` are not used.

Host checks exercise proportional advances, wrapping, scrolling/clipping, blank
space, Japanese-only taps, CR/newline handling, supplementary Han and unavailable
layout. Existing worker tests verify that changing highlight mode preserves OCR
and that rapid selected lookups cannot publish stale definitions. Config tests
cover both modes and invalid values; transactional preference tests preserve
unrelated config bytes and exercise save/restore failures.

These checks validate the portable helper and worker/config integration. Native
PAF font geometry, finger hit accuracy and game touch routing require hardware
validation and are recorded separately from host results.
